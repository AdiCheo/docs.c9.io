You might decide later on to turn an existing public project into a private one. At the moment, we don't have an easy way to turn public Cloud9 projects into private projects.\n\nYou can get around this limitation by using a code-hosting site like GitHub or Bitbucket to push and pull your Cloud9 projects. You can do so by following these steps:\n\n1. Create an account in a code-hosting site that supports private repositories (Bitbucket offers free private repos, so that might be your best option.)\n2. Link the account at the code-hosting site with your Cloud9 account (see **Add-on Services** under **Your Account** in the Dashboard)\n3. Push the public Cloud9 project you want to convert to private to the code-hosting site.\n4. Go to the Cloud9 Dashboard and select \"clone from url\" with the URL from the new private repository at the code-hosting site; select \"Only the people I specify (premium feature)\". That would create a new private project from the repository you provide in the url.\n5. Delete the old public project in Cloud9.\n\nIf you're not sure how to link your projects to Bitbucket, [this article on \"Setting Up a Git Project (on BitBucket)\" might be useful](setting_up_bitbucket_project.html)."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1351}]],"length":1351}
