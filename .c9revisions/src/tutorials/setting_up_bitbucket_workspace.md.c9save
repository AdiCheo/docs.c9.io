For this article, we're assuming that you have created a git project in Cloud9. Let's see how you can push this project to Bitbucket.\n\nFirst, if you haven't done so already, create a Bitbucket account. Then, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to your Cloud9 dashboard. Click on **Your Account** and, under **Account Settings**, click on **Show your SSH key** and copy the key.\n![Viewing your SSH key](./images/sshKey.png)\n\n2. In BitBucket, go to **Account Settings**, and then click on **[SSH Keys](https://bitbucket.org/account/#ssh-keys)**. \nPaste the Cloud9 SSH key into the textbox. Then, click **Add key**.\n\n3. Create a git repository on Bitbucket. At the top, you will see: \"Clone this repository (size: ... bytes): HTTPS/SSH\". Click on SSH. Then, underneath it will show a URL of the form `git@bitbucket.org:username/reponame.git`. Copy this URL.\n![Cloning from Bitbucket](./images/cloneBitbucket.png)\n\n4. Go to your Cloud9 project. If you created it as a git project, git is already setup. If you haven't already, commit any changes using the console:\n\tgit add .\n\tgit commit -a -m \"My first commit\"\n\n5. Add a new remote repository from the Cloud9 console; for instance:\n\tgit remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:username/repository_name.git\n\n6. Finally, you can push to this repository:\n\tgit push origin master\n\nYour changes will appear on Bitbucket."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1509}]],"length":1509}
