Accessing the command is no different than the way you'd use Python on your computer; just open the command line and type `python`. Currently, we run version 2.6.6.\n\nTo run a Python program that you've created, you can either:\n\n* Open the command line and  type `python`, followed by the name of your program; for example `python hello_world.py`\n* Create a new run scenario, so that you can do things like pass in command line arguments. For more information, see the section on [Running Code](./running_and_debugging_code.html)\n\nAs a quick demonstration, open a new file, and paste this Python code into it:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nprint \"Hello World!\";\n```\n\nWhen you hit the **run** button in the menu bar, the console will print out the statement."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":870}]],"length":870,"saved":false}
