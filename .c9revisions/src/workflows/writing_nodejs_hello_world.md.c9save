If you followed our last two lessons, you already have a Cloud9 IDE account and you know how to create a project. To get started with this lesson, you'll need to first create a (GitHub or Mercurial) project. If you need a refresher on how to do this, please refer to [Creating a New Workspace](creating_new_workspace.html).\n\n#### A Simple Node.js HTTP Server\n\nOnce you have created your project, click on the **Start Editing** button to go to the Cloud9 IDE editor. In the editor, create a new file called `server.js`. Type the following code in the file:\n\n    var http = require('http');\n    http.createServer(function (req, res) {\n        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n        res.end('Hello World\\n');\n    }).listen(process.env.PORT);\n        \nWhat you just wrote is a Node.js HTTP server that returns a simple 'Hello World' page for every request. In short, you are creating an HTTP server with a callback function that is called for each request. In the callback function, you create a response with a status code of `200` (indicating that the request was fulfilled successfully) and the message \"Hello World\". Finally, you specify which port the server listens to. When Node.js projects run within Cloud9 IDE, you can retrieve the port information with the `process.env.PORT` variable.\n\n#### Running your program\n\nWith Cloud9 IDE, you can run your Node.js applications in a test environment and see the results of your program. To run your \"Hello, World\" application, click on the **Run** button in the project bar. All you need to do now is double-click the name of your new file to get it running:  \n![A new run configuration pop-up](./images/newRunConfiguration.png)\n\nYour application will be deployed to one of our servers, and you will immediately see some output in the console similar to the one below:  \n![Console run output](./images/RunOutput.png)\n\nTo see your application in action, click on the link created for your project. You should see your \"Hello World\" application open up in a new browser tab:  \n![Node.js Hello World in the Browser](./images/helloWorld.png).\n\nTo stop your application, go back to the editor and click on the [![Icon of the Stop Button](./icons/stop_button.png)]{: #stopButton} button in the menu bar.\n\nFor more information on running and debugging your projects, check out [this article](./running_and_debugging_your_code.html)."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2547}]],"length":2547}
