At its heart, the color picker is a way to represent words (`red`, `blue`), RGBA values (`rgba(175, 3, 124, .6)`), or hex values (`#f00f00`) into actual colors. \n\nYou can use the color picker in CSS, SVG, HTML, or APF Skin files. All you have to do is hover over the value of a color definition; it'll instantly highlight: ![Color picker highlight](./images/colorPickerHighlight.png)\n\nNext, click on the highlighted color. You'll get a color square defining all possible arrangements. You can click in the square, pick your own RGB or HSB values, or enter some hex code. Best of all, at the bottom of the wheel, you'll find a list of other colors within the same document--just in case you want to achieve matching shades:\n![Color picker wheel](./images/colorPickerWheel.png)\n\nThat's it! To set the value, just click outside of the color picker."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1144}]],"length":1144}
