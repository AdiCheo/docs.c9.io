These feature include:\n\n![A summary of the tab context menu](./images/tab_menu.png)\n\n* Reveal in File Tree: opens the current file in the Project Files tree\n* Close Tab: closes the current tab\n* Close All Tabs: closes all the opened files\n* Close All But Current Tab: closes all the opened files, except the current one\n* Close Tabs to the Right/Left: closes all opened tabs to the right (or left) of the current one \n\nThere are also a number of keyboard shortcuts you can perform, including:   \n\n* Adding a new tab with the `Alt+Shift+n` keyboard shortcut\n* Cycling through your tabs by holding the `Alt` key and pressing `Tab` multiple times.\n* Jumping directly to a tab by holding `Command` (or `Ctrl` on Windows). followed by the number of the tab's position (_e.g._ `Command 2` takes you to the second tab; `Command 0` takes you to the tenth)\n\n \n### Tab Sessions \n\nTab sessions is a unique feature that is useful when dealing with projects that involve juggling between many tabs. Here's a video highlighting its use:\n\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/agUno6WDkAM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nEssentially, tab sessions lets you save the current state of the tabs. You can close your workspace, switch to a different branch, and instantly reload your previously opened files. You'll no longer need to work with opening and closing multiple files.\n\nTo use tab sessions, select **Save Tab Sessions** from the tab menu. Give it a unique name. When you're ready to restore your tab sessions, just select **Load Tab Sessions**. \n\nIf you find that you've got too many tab sessions defined, you can always choose to delete them from the same tab menu."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1822}]],"length":1822}
