It's where you can enter command line input, view output from your program, and manipulate your projects between your code repositories. \n\n### Available Commands\n\nYou can use most Unix commands, such as `ls` and `mkdir`, in the console space. To preview the full list of basic commands in the console, you can type `help` and press Enter. For every command, a description is provided:\n\n![Screenshot of the available commands](./images/availableCommands.png)\n\nYou can also use mercurial commands (`hg`) and git commands (`git`) to communicate with the system, and to push your code between repositories. Typing `hg` or `git` shows the complete list of commands that are available for these services. For more information about these commands, please check their respective documentation:\n\n* [Mercurial Command List](http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide)\n* [Git Command List](http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets)\n\nTo use mercurial commands on the project you are working on, you must have a mercurial project set up; the same holds true for git. Follow these links to learn more about how to set up these project in Cloud9:\n\n* [Setting up a Mercurial Project](./setting_up_bitbucket_workspace.html)\n* [Setting up a Git project (on GitHub)](./setting_up_github_workspace.html)\n\nThese articles also explain how to use the command-line to commit your work.\n\nIn addition, the console also has shortcuts for much of Cloud9 IDE's functionality. For example, `gotofile` launches the filename you provide, while `revealtab` opens the current file in the project tree. Again, typing `help` shows you which commands are available.\n\n### Output\n\nThe output tab in the console shows information whenever a user is running or debugging a program. The content is similar to the output of a desktop terminal, except it's in the same window as your editor. No need to juggle between windows anymore!\n\n![Screenshot of program output](./images/consoleOutput.png)\n\nThe output tab also displays the error and additional information that can improve your coding quality. You can use the console to output results from your running application, just like a regular terminal.\n\n### Search\n\nThe console also displays information about files containing search terms:\n\n![Screenshot of search results](./images/searchResults.png)\n\nYou can expand each result to see the line number of where a match was found. Clicking on a match opens the file in the IDE."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2508}]],"length":2508}
