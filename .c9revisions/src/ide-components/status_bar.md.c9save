It's quite tiny, and quite powerful, like a weight-lifting squirrel.\n\nYou can find the status bar in the lower-right corner of the editor: ![The status bar in its natural, shortened state](./icons/statusBarCollapsed.png). Keep in mind that the status bar is transparent, so it's able to camoflauge well with light or dark themes.\n\nThere's three pieces of crucial information available at all times: your current row, your current column, and, if you're highlighting characters, the status bar displays the number of bytes currently selected.\n\nIf you click on the status bar, it expands into a menu that provides a smaller set of [the full ide preferences](ide_preferences.html). Mostly, these options deal with visual formatting for the IDE:\n\n* Show Invisibles: {:invisibleChars}\n* Wraps Lines: wraps lines according to the line margin defined, or your browser's window. Otherwise, lines run off the current viewport.\n* Code Folding: {:codeFolding}\n* Full Line Selection: {:fullLineSelection}\n* Highlight Active Line: {:highlightActiveLine}\n* Show Gutter: {:showGutter}\n* Highlight Selected Word: {:highlightSelectedWord}\n* Auto-pair Quotes, Brackets, etc.: {:autoPair}\n* Auto-hide Horizontal Scrollbar: {:autoHideHorizontalScroll}\n* Font Size: {:fontSize}\n* Show Print Margin: {:showPrintMargin}\n* Soft Tabs: {:softTabs}\n* Mouse Scroll Speed: {:mouseScrollSpeed}"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1536}]],"length":1536}
