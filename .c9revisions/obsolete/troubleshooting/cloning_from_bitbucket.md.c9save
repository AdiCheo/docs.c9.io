However, as of this writing, Cloud9 IDE assumes that any repository that you want to clone from BitBucket is a Mercurial repository. As a result, if you have a Git repository in BitBucket and try to clone to edit this project from the dashboard, the cloning will fail.\n\nYou can get around this problem easily by fixing the url that Cloud9 IDE generates when you attempt to clone. When cloning a BitBucket repository, Cloud9 IDE uses a source url like the following:\n\n    ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/username/repositoryname \n    \nTo clone a Git repository from BitBucket, change the url to look like this:\n\n    git@bitbucket.org:username/repositoryname.git\n    \nNotice the following differences:\n\n* We have removed `ssh://\n* We have changed `hg` to `git`\n* We have added `.git` to the end of the url\n\nNow, you should be able to clone your git repository from BitBucket!"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":963}]],"length":963}
