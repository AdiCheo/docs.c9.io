## Applying Themes and Syntax Highlighting

<!-- add video here -->

Cloud9 IDE supports over two dozen different themes for highlighting your code. You can change your current theme by going to **View | Themes**, and selecting from one of the options. Note that by hovering over the menu items, you'll be able to get a preview of the theme. To activate a theme you like, just click on its name.

By default, files are highlighted based on their file extension. You can change this by going to **View | Syntax**, and selecting a different context.

As a general reference, the IDE supports themes for these following languages:

<div style="-moz-column-count: 2; -moz-column-gap: 20px; -webkit-column-count: 2; -webkit-column-gap: 20px; column-count: 2; column-gap: 20px;">
