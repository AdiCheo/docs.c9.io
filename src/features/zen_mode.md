## Activating Zen Mode

Zen mode is a full screen coding environment designed to make you more productive. It essentially removes all the additional UI elements in Cloud9 IDE, and places you in a harmonious relationship with your code.

Here's a video demonstrating the feature:

To activate zen mode, simply hover over the upper right corner of the code editor, and click the icon that appears. Keep in mind that you'll need to have a file open before you can launch zen mode. You can resize your window by holding and dragging the left or right border.

To get out of zen mode, hover over the same corner and click the same icon.

You can also enter and exit zen mode via keyboard shortcuts, command line, or from the menu bar at **View | Zen Mode**.
