## Activating Zen Mode

Zen mode is a full screen coding environment design to make you more productive. It essentially removes all the additional UI elements in Cloud9 IDE, and places you in a harmonious relationship with your code. Groovy.

Here's a video demonstrating the feature:




To activate zen mode, simply hover over the upper right corner of the code editor. Keep in mind that you'll need to have a file open before you can launch zen mode. You can resize your coding space by holding and dragging the left or right side of the coding window.

To get out of zen mode, hover over the same corner and click the button!

For those who entirely eschew the mouse, zen mode can also be activated in [the console](./console.html) by typing `zenmode`.
