## The Minimap

The minimap is an easy visualization of your code. It presents a smaller version of your code within the editor:

You can jump through your code by clicking directly onto the minimap. To enable it, go to **View | Show Minimap**. This feature works best on really large code files, so try it out on your next massive project!
