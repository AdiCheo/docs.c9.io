# Revisions

<!-- video -->

Every time you save a file on Cloud9, a diff of any changes made to it is by the server. Over time, you can view these file revisions as content is added and removed from. You can also restore a file to any previously saved state; you'll never have to worry about losing your work ever again!

To access file revisions, you can either go to **File | File Revisions History**, or type `Cmd-B` (on Mac) / `Ctrl-B` (on Windows). This will pop-open the Revisions History panel. Red lines indicate lines that were removed; green lines indicate lines that were either added or changed.

At the bottom of the panel, there's a checkbox for showing all of a file's changes. Files changes that occur relatively soon to one another--say, a few seconds--are grouped by the revisions panel as one "change." If you prefer to see every single change as an individual entry, enable the **Show all file changes** checkbox.

To restore a file to a previous revision, simply click the revisions button: ![Revisions Button](./icons/revisions_button.png)
