# Uploading and Downloading Workspace Files

Cloud9 IDE allows you to easily add files to your curent workspace at any time. You can drag and drop files from your computer directly into the Project Files pane, and the IDE will add them to your project. Google Chrome users can also drag entire folders into the IDE. 

If a file transfer is halted for some reason--say, if you lose your internet connection--the upload resumes once the connection returns. As the files transfer, the IDE lets you know the current status of the overall transfer, as well as the status of each file being uploaded:

You can also get an exact copy of your workspace to save on your computer. By going into [[menu: File, Download Project]], you will be provided with a Zip file containing the entirety of your project.
