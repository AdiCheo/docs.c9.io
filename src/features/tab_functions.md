## Tab Functions

Cloud9 IDE offers advanced tab features to make working with multiple files easy. These feature include:

* Reveal in File Tree: opens the current file in the Project Files tree
* Close Tab: closes the current tab
* Close All Tabs: closes all the opened files
* Close All But Current Tab: closes all the opened files, except the current one
* Close Tabs to the Right/Left: closes all opened tabs to the right (or left) of the current one 

There are also a number of keyboard shortcuts you can perform, including:   

* Adding a new tab with the `Alt+Shift+n` keyboard shortcut
* Cycling through your tabs by holding the `Alt` key and pressing `Tab` multiple times.
* Jumping directly to a tab by holding `Command` (or `Ctrl` on Windows). followed by the number of the tab's position (_e.g._ `Command 2` takes you to the second tab; `Command 0` takes you to the tenth)

 
### Tab Sessions 

Tab sessions is a unique feature that is useful when dealing with projects that involve juggling between many tabs. Here's a video highlighting its use:

Essentially, tab sessions lets you save the current state of the tabs. You can close your workspace, switch to a different branch, and instantly reload your previously opened files. You'll no longer need to work with opening and closing multiple files.

To use tab sessions, select **Save Tab Sessions** from the tab menu. Give it a unique name. When you're ready to restore your tab sessions, just select **Load Tab Sessions**. 

If you find that you've got too many tab sessions defined, you can always choose to delete them from the same tab menu.
