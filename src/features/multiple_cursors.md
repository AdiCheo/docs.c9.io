# Multiple Cursors

Multiple cursors is one of the most useful features available in the Cloud9 editor. You can use multiple cursors to perform tasks like rename several variables or members at once, break up lists separated by commas, or insert the same text in multiple locations.

Multiple selections can be copied and pasted, and you can insert or remove entire lines in several locations.

There are several ways to get access to mutliple cursors:

* Via keyboard shortcuts, you can create a new cursor in any direction
* By holding the [[keys: Alt]] key, clicking the mouse, and dragging the cursor up or down in the editor
* Through the menu bar at [[menu: Selection, Multiple Selections]]

One of the best capabilities is the ability to instantly select the next instance of your currently highlighted section. This is especially useful for refactoring several parts of the code at once. To do this, press [[keys: Ctrl-Alt]], followed by the right (or left) arrow key to navigate around in the code.
