# Collaboration

Collaboration with Cloud9 IDE is an amazing feature that lets you share your projects with any other Cloud9 user. You can grant someone access to change files in your workspace, or just let them view the workspace without any other rights.

To invite someone to collaborate on a project with you, simply copy the URL in the browser and send it to a friend. You can also click on **Share** in the menu bar to get quick access to other ways to share, like via e-mail, Twitter, or Facebook.

Let's take a look at some of the additional features available while you collaborate.

### Members List

There are two terms used for users accessing your project: **members** and **visitors**. Members are users that have read and write access to your project, while visitors only have read access. The Members panel lists all the collaborators in a project, both active and inactive:

If you are the owner of a project, you can click on anyone's user name to grant (or revoke) write access:

### Chatting

Any member, regardless of write access, can participate in group chat. You can also choose to double-click on a member's username and engage in a private, instant-message-style conversation.

### Viewing Users' Cursors

In order to keep track of who is doing what in a workspace, every member in a project is given a different colored cursor. The cursor is used to identify who a particular member is. Hovering over the cursor shows the username of that member, and clicking on that name allows you to privately message them.
