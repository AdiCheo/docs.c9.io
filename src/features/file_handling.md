Here's what they mean:

* **Revert to Saved** lets you to revert your file to its last saved version.
* **Save** (including **Save As** and **Save All**) allow you to: 
 * Save the file you are currently working on (**Save**)
 * Save your current file with a different name and/or in a different location (**Save As ...**)
 * Save all your open file (**Save All**)

* **Open Recent** lets you reopen you recently closed files from a menu.
* **New** (including **New File**, **New from Template**, and **New Folder**) offer their expected functionality. **New from Template** presents you with a menu with several options of file template to choose from.
