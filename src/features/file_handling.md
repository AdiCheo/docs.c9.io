Here's what they mean:

* **Revert to Saved** lets you to revert the current file to its last saved version. This is only possible if you have a changed file you haven't saved yet.
*Â **Save** (including **Save As** and **Save All**) allow you to: 
 * Save the file you are currently working on (**Save**)
 * Save your current file with a different name and/or in a different location (**Save As...**)
 * Save all your open files (**Save All**)
* **Open** lets you open a file in your project. You can achieve the same effect by double-click on a file's name in the Project Files tree.
* **Open Recent** lets you reopen you recently closed files from a menu.
* **New** (including **New File**, **New from Template**, and **New Folder**) offer their expected functionality. **New from Template** presents you with a menu with several options of file template to choose from.
