# Autocompletion

For Javascript programs, Cloud9 IDE provides intelligent and responsive autocompletion for your code. Autocompletion is based not only on the content within your files, but also on the ECMAScript and Node.js standard library:



Methods defined in ECMAScript and Node.js also have documentation provided for you. Simply hover over a method name for a moment, and a second box quickly shows some additional information.

You can disable autocompletion in the [**Settings**](./ide_preferences.html) menu.
