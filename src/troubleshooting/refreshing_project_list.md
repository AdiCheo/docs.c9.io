## Refreshing Your GitHub or Mercurial Project List

The listing of your projects from GitHub and Mercurial is reloaded whenever you log in through GitHub or Mercurial. After login, the list of projects remains unchanged. This means that if you create a new project GitHub Github (outside of Cloud9 IDE), you won't see the change reflected on Cloud9 IDE until you log in again through GitHub. Moreover, if you log in again using your username/password, you still won't see your new project listed.

You can get around this by pressing the reload button in the lower-left corner of the Dashboard:
