## Logging-In

Below are some common problems when logging in, and how to resolve them.

### Forgotten Password

Every now and again we forget our password.

You can get your password reset at the top of every page where you would normally sign-in:

![Forgotten password link](./images/forgotten_password.png)

Then, you can fill in your details:

### Resending Your Confirmation Email

If you tried to sign-up and didnâ€™t receive your activation email for your account, you can have it resent to your email address.

Just go here: http://c9.io/site/resend-confirmation-email/

All you need to do is fill in your email address again, and we will resend it.

Tip: Check your junk mail too just in case our message was removed by your email provider.
