## Refreshing Your GitHub or Mercurial Project List

The listing of your projects from GitHub and Mercurial is reloaded whenever you log in through GitHub or Mercurial. After login, the list of projects remains unchanged. This means that if you create a new project GitHub Github (outside of Cloud9 IDE), you won't see the change reflected on Cloud9 IDE until you log in again through GitHub. Moreover, if you log in again using your username/password, you still won't see your new project listed.

You can get around this with a little-known feature in Cloud9 IDE: reloading your project list by clicking on the GitHub/Mercurial icon under Add-on Services:

If you linked your Github or Mercurial account to your Cloud9 IDE account, you will see the corresponding icon in color under Add-on Services. Clicking on the icon instantly reloads your project listing!
