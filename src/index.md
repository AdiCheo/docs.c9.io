# Cloud9 IDE User Documentation

Welcome to the Cloud9 IDE documentation! Here, you'll find articles and tutorials to help you use the Cloud9 platform. These include everything from setting up git workspaces, to learning how to run, debug, and deploy your code.

If you're interested in troubleshooting specific aspects of the IDE, need help setting up an account, or want to chat with our support team, please [read the Cloud9 IDE support forum](http://support.cloud9ide.com/forums).

Don't forget to check out [our YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/c9ide/videos?flow=grid&view=1) which contains videos describing many of the features of the IDE, as well as providing additional tutorials. Our videos are also available on relevant documentation pages.

Remember: all of our documentation content is [open-sourced on GitHub](http://github.com/c9/cloud9ide-documentation), just like our IDE.
