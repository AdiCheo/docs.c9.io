## The Dashboard

From the dashboard, you can edit your profile and manage projects and organizations you're a part of.

After you have logged into Cloud9, you are directed to the dashboard of your account. The dashboard consists of two contexts: user context and organization context.

### User Context

In the top-left corner of the dashboard, your username is displayed. Within the user context, you can view your user profile by clicking on **Your Account**:

The user profile contains:

* Your recent activities, including a list of actions you have recently performed, such as cloning, opening, and deleting projects
* Your add-on services, which you've integrated into Cloud9. Currently, these are [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org).
* Your account settings, where you're given the following choices:
    * Change your password
    * Change your email
    * Show your SSH key
    * Upgrade to premium (or, downgrade from it)
    * Enter a promotion code
    * Delete your account
    
The gravatar that is used for your profile is handled by [gravatar.com](http://www.gravatar.com. If you don't have a gravatar yet, Cloud9 IDE uses its default.

Under 'Your Account' in the left panel, there is a tab called **PROJECTS**. This contains all the projects you added to Cloud9 IDE. The list is sorted by groups depending on your account settings. The groups are:  

* My Projects
* Shared Projects
* Organization Projects
* Projects on GitHub (public and private)
* Projects on Bitbucket (public and private)

Clicking on the ![Project Add Icon](./icons/projectPlusIcon.png) next to **MY PROJECTS** lets you to:

* Create a new project
* Clone from URL

### Organization Context

Within this context you can organize Cloud9 users to become members of projects you want to collaborate on. To switch into the organization context, click on the **Active Context** drop-down menu. Here, you'll have the option of creating a new organization, or switching to an already existing one:
