## The Project Bar

The project bar is the leftmost content area in the Cloud9 IDE. It controls the behavior of your IDE, as well as the presentation of your code to help you design in the style you like:

The project bar has several buttons. From top to bottom, they are: **Project Files**, **Active Files**, **Preferences**, and **Deploy**. Pressing any of these buttons activates a different view in the panel to the right of the buttons. In more detail:

* **Project Files**: shows your project's directory structure, which appears in the panel to the right. You can view all your files here. Right-click in this area to reveal a drop-down menu to create new files, copy/paste within your project, and other options.
* **Active Files**: shows your files that are currently open.
* **Run**: lets you run and debug your code live, in the browser. For more information, see [the section on "Running and Debugging Your Code".](./running_and_debugging_your_code.html).
* **Deploy**: allows you to deploy to a Heroku, Joyent, or Windows Azure production server. For more information, see [the section on "Deploying Your Code".](./deploying_your_code.html).
* **Preferences**: lets you change the behavior of the editor. Since there's a lot of information here, the Preferences documentation is provided [on its own page](ide_preferences.html).


Clicking on any button expands its menu. Clicking on an expanded menu causes it to collapse, which gives you a little more space to work with.
