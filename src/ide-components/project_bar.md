## About the Project Bar

The project bar is the leftmost content area in the Cloud9 IDE. It controls the behavior of your IDE, as well as the presentation of your code to help you design in the style you like:

Clicking on any button can expand its menu. Clicking on an expanded menu causes it to collapse, which gives you a little more space to work with.

By default, the Project Files window is enabled. This button toggles whether or not your entire project is visibile.

The **Open Files** button lists all the files that are currently open in your editor.

The **Run** and **Deploy** buttons are relatively complex. For more information on these, see the ["Running Your Code"](running_your_code.html) and ["Deploying Your Code"](deploying_your_code.html) sections.

**Preferences** is where the magic happens. These configuration options change the behavior of the editor. Since there's a lot of information here, the Preferences documentation is provided [on its own page](ide_preferences.html).
