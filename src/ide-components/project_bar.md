## The Project Bar

The project bar is located towards the left of the Cloud9 IDE: ![The Project Bar](./images/project_bar.png)

The buttons in the project bar allow you to reveal and hide panels for the IDE. In more detail:

* Pressing on the Cloud9 icon collapses the panel area
* **Project Files** shows your workspace's directory structure. You can view all your files here. Right-click in this area to reveal a drop-down menu with additional options.
* **Active Files** shows your files that are currently open.
* **Run & Debug** lets you run and debug your code live, in the browser. For more information, see [the section on "Running and Debugging Your Code".](./running_and_debugging_code.html).
* **Deploy** allows you to deploy to a variety of services. For more information, see [the section on "Deploying Your Code".](./deploying_code.html).
* **Preferences** lets you change the behavior of the editor. The Preferences documentation is provided [on its own page](ide_preferences.html).

Clicking on any button expands its menu. Clicking on an expanded menu causes it to collapse, which gives you a little more space to work with.
