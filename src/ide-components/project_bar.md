## About the Project Bar

The project bar is the leftmost content area in the Cloud9 IDE. It controls the behavior of your IDE, as well as the presentation of your code to help you design in the style you like:

#### The Project Bar and Panel

On the left side section of the editor is the Project bar. It has four large buttons. From top to bottom, they are: **Project Files**, **Active Files**, **Preferences**, and **Deploy**. Pressing any of these buttons activates a different view in the panel to the right of the buttons. In more detail:

* **Project Files**: Activates a view of your project's directory structure, which appears in the panel to the right. You can view all your files here. Right-click in this area to access a a drop-down menu to create new files, copy/paste and other options.
* **Active Files**: Activates a view of the files that are currently open.
* **Preferences**: Gives you access to general settings and editor settings
* **Deploy**: Allows you to create a Heroku or Joyent No.de deploy server.

Clicking on any button can expand its menu. Clicking on an expanded menu causes it to collapse, which gives you a little more space to work with.

By default, the Project Files window is enabled. This button toggles whether or not your entire project is visibile.

The **Open Files** button lists all the files that are currently open in your editor.

The **Run** and **Deploy** buttons are relatively complex. For more information on these, see [the section on "Running and Debugging Your Code".](./running_and_debugging_your_code.html).

**Preferences** is where the magic happens. These configuration options change the behavior of the editor. Since there's a lot of information here, the Preferences documentation is provided [on its own page](ide_preferences.html).
