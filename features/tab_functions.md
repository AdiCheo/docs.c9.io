## Tab Functions

Cloud9 IDE offers advanced tab features to make working with multiple open files easy. These feature include:

* Reordering tabs by dragging horizontally
* Adding a new tab with the Alt+Shift+n keyboard shortcut
* Switching between two tabs by pressing Alt+Tab
* Cycling through your tabs by pressing Tab multiple times while holding the Alt key.

See these features in action in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=eFkDQd3GKBQ).
