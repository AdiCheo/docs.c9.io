## Rename a Cloned Project

When you clone a project, the project created in your account inherits the name of the original project. At the moment, Cloud9 IDE does not allow users to change the name of a project once it is already created. However, you can get around this problem by cloning a project twice.

Here's how it works: the first clone inherits the name of the original project. When you clone the project a second time, Cloud9 identifies that another project with the same name already exists (the first clone) and it will ask you to enter a new name. This is your chance to rename the project.

You will be left with two clones: one with the original name and one with your chosen name. Now, you can just delete the first clone and keep the one with the desired project name.
