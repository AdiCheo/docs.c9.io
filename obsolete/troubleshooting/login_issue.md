## Logging-In

Below are some common problems when logging in, and how to resolve them.

### Forgotten Password

Every now and again we forget our password. It's okay. It happens.

You can get your password reset at the top of every page on the Cloud9 website where you would normally sign-in:

After clicking the link, you can fill in your details:

### Resending Your Confirmation Email

If you tried to sign-up and didnâ€™t receive your activation email for your account, you can have it resent to your email address.

Just go here: http://c9.io/site/resend-confirmation-email/

All you need to do is fill in your email address again, and we will resend it.

Tip: Check your junk mail, too, just in case our message was removed by your email provider.
