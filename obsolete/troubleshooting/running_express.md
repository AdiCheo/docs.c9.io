## Running the Express Module in Cloud9 IDE

The [express npm module](http://expressjs.com/index.html) can't be run from the console. However, there is another way to use it for your applications.

After installing express with NPM, you can run express from the editor. 

Click on **Run** in [the project bar](./project_bar.html), and set the run configuration like this:

   name: express (or whatever your filename is)
   path: node_modules/express/bin/express
