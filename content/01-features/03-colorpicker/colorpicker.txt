The color picker is an awesome feature in Cloud9 IDE, designed to not only make color selections easier, but also, more harmonious. At its core, the color picker is a way to represent words (`red`, `blue`, _e.t.c._), RGBA values (`rgba(175, 3, 124, .6)`), or hex values (`#f00f00`) into actual colors. 

To enable the color picker, flip the preferences on in [the **Settings** panel](./ide_preferences.html). You can use the color picker in CSS, SVG, HTML, or [APF](http://apf.ajax.org) Skin files. All you have to do is hover over the value of a color definition; it'll instantly highlight: ![Color picker highlighting](./images/colorPickerHighlight.png)

When the represented color is highlighted, click on it. You'll get a color square defining all the possible color arrangements. To select a color, you can click in the square, pick your own RGB or HSB values, or enter some hex code. Best of all, at the bottom of the wheel, you'll find a list of other colors found within the same document--just in case you want to achieve matching shades:

That's it! To set the value, just click anywhere outside of the color picker.
